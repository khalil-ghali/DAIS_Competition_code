TextGenius is a tool designed to facilitate question and answer interactions based on PDF documents, Youtube videos and websites. 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.9+ recommended)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khalil-ghali/DAIS_Competition_code.git

2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd DAIS_Competition_code
    ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies: 
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the app:
   ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
## Please Note that if you have a CUDA compatible graphic card, your app will run on GPU for faster processing, if you don't have it that's fine It will run on you CPU but a little slower. 

## In Case you want to use the .ipynb notebook in google colab preferably (most packages are already preinstalled in google colab)
  1. forget about previous steps.
  2. activate a free GPU runtime for faster processing(works just fine with normal CPU runtime also)
  3. initiate the tunnel.
  4. follow the instructions written in each cell of the notebook
